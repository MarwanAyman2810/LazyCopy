# LazyCopy

this is a small clipboard tool that automatically pops up whenever the user selects any text then hides after the text is pasted.

coded because i am too lazy to right click or grab the keyboard while chiling on yt in bed.

## to try out

linux with X11 display servers compatible only.

make sure you have [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed first 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarwanAyman2810/LazyCopy.git
cd LazyCopy
go run main.go
```
